# -Predictive-Maintenance-System

Project Example:
One of the projects I worked on build a predictive maintenance system for data science course . 
The goal was to predict when a machine would likely fail, allowing for timely maintenance and reducing downtime
Here is an Key Steps in this Project:
1.	Data Collection:
First I create a historical data from my own machines, including temperature, vibration, and usage hours.
For model developing 
2.	Data Preprocessing: 
I clean and normalized the data, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering to create meaningful input features.
3.	Model Building: 
Then I used a combination of machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to build predictive models.
4.	Model Evaluation:
after that, for model evaluation ,i evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure they met the performance criteria.
5.	Deployment: 
then I deployed the best-performing model into a real-time monitoring system that alerts maintenance teams when a machine is likely to fail.
